    Stay focused. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. Find peace, life is like a
    water fall, you’ve gotta flow. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the
    shower,
    dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know
    the key to success. It’s important to use cocoa butter. It’s the key to more success, why not
    live
    smooth? Why live rough? Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t
    want
    us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast.

    They will try to close the door on you, just open it. Wraith talk. The key to more success is to
    have a lot of pillows. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success.
    The
    other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. In life
    there will be road blocks but we will over come it. Cloth talk. Surround yourself with angels,
    positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. They don’t want us to
    eat.
    The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t
    want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile.
